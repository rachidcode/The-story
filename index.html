            <p class="forme"><b>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective
                    on
                    Mars
                    or that gaz
                    opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and
                    there’s no
                    such
                    thing as an issue.

                    Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think
                    it.
                    Nothing
                    exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our
                    reality
                    changes.
                    That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we
                    mis
                    translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
                    on
                    that
                    way.
                    Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.

                    They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull
                    yourself
                    out of
                    that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.
                    But
                    the
                    person
                    is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can
                    make
                    your
                    world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</b></p>

            <p class="forme">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his
                neighbors came around
                to com miserate. They said,<q class="villagers"> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                    is
                    most unfortunate.”</q>
                The farmer said,<q class="farmer"> “Is it <span class="Good">Good</span>? Is it <span
                        class="Bad">Bad</span>? I don't know.”</q> The
                next day the horse came
                back bringing seven wild
                horses
                with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky.
                    What a
                    great turn of events.
                    You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"> “Is it <span
                        class="Good">Good</span>? Is it <span class="Bad">Bad</span>? I don't
                    know.”</q>

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his
                leg. The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers"> “Oh dear, that’s too <span
                        class="Bad">Bad</span>,”</q>
                and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">“Is
                    it <span class="Good">
                        Good</span>? Is it <span class="Bad">Bad</span>? I
                    don't know.”</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the
                army,
                and they
                rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q
                    class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</q>
                Again, he said, <q class="farmer">“Is it <span class="Good">Good</span>? Is it <span
                        class="Bad">Bad</span>?
                    I don't know.”</q>

        <blockquote> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
            impossible to tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <span class="Good">Good</span> or <span class="Bad">Bad</span> —
            because you never know what will
            be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="Good">Good</span> fortune.
